# Let's Get Started with Node, NPM and Grunt

## Install Global Dependencies
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Grunt (http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

## Check Global Dependencies Correctly Installed
- command line, run: 'node --v' //v0.12.7 or equivalent
- command line, run: 'npm -v' //2.11.3 or equivalent
- command line, run: 'npm grunt --version' //2.11.3 or equivalent

## Steps to Get Started
- download the zip file and unzip into a directory of your choosing.
- cd into directory
- run: 'npm install' // it will hopefully successfully install local dependencies list in the package.json file in the root directory. This sets the app up ready for development.
- in the command line, run: 'grunt' //The tasks should run and give you a read out of the time it took to complete each tasks
- you can also run: 'grunt dev' which will watch changes to the js or scss files
- open up example.html to see your changes!

## Try a Couple tasks
- make a change to the styles inside 'public/sass/css' while having 'grunt watch' live in the command line
- do the same thing to the javascript inside 'public/sass/js'
- make changes to css and js and see them reflected in example.html.

### Congratulations! You're up and running with node, npm and grunt!
